PART 1:
You've hardcoded the number of values that should be found.  Ideally, you should be processing whatever you find there.  -1

PART 2:
Good

PART 3:
Great

PART 4:
In the assert statements, I gave you some suggested column names, but you chose your own.  That made verifying your code difficult.  The results look correct, though.

PART 5:
I couldn't get your code to run exactly as you had it.  I think that along the way, you made the mistake of joining on the FIPS code rather than on the location.  That would have produced a lot of NaN. -1

PART 6:
Good thoughts.  Thanks!
