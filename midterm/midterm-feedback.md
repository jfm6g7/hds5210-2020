# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
46 / 50

Generally, you had all the right ideas.  Take a little bit of care when naming your functions.


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  They all look great.

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - Generally all good.  I think you needed to use some more meaningful function names, though.  one, two, three... don't really let us know what they're for.  (-1)

In your "three" function, you've had to hardcode the "Acute Renal Failure" etc.  You could have simply said acute_score.get(a_c).  (-1)

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - You had the right idea, but iterrows returns two things - an index and the row value itself.  You could have gotten there pretty quickly, I think.  (-1)

You also didn't complete the comparison part of the assignment.  (-1)
