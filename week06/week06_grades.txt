It looks like you struggled quite a bit with looping over individual components inside the JSON data structure.  When you're working on those, I recommend breaking it down into smaller pieces and write some separate code outside of the function to test what you're doing and examine the data content.

    obj = json.load(open('allergies.json'))
    patient = obj.get('entry')[0].get('resource').get('patient')

    print(dumps(patient, indent=4)
    print(type(patient))

And look at the output of that.

The second thing to remember is that you can always loop over a list using for.

  for patient in patients:
    ...

You had some good thoughts going there.  I'm going to give you 2/5 for module 30.
